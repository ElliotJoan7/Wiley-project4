<!-- a "div" is like a box where you can put content. These boxes can be moved around the web page, and you can stick lots of web elements in these boxes.
The "id" below refers to an "id tag" that styles this div in a specific way--you will find the styling in the .css file.-->

  <div id="bio">
    <h1><u>Elliot Wiley</u> (college student) is an artist specializing in digital media.</h1>
  </div>

<!--the "a href" tag creates a link. In this case, I gave each project its own link so
that it will take you to that particular project on this page. See below where the "id"
of each project div is labeled "project1" or "project2" (etc.)-->
  <div>
    <ul> <!--"ul" means "unordered list. Each of the "li" (or "list items") will be marked with a bullet point.-->
      <h2>IDEAS 120 CLASS PROJECTS</h2>
      <li>PROJECT 1: <a href="#project1">Github Poetry</a></li>
      <li>PROJECT 2: <a href="#project2">Zoom Background</a></li>
      <li>PROJECT 3: <a href="#project3">Twine Game</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<!--the "class" tag works a lot like the "id" tag, except it's helpful to use for a whole class
of divs - in this case, the "img_left" class will style all the images I want to align to the left
of the page.-->
  <div class="img_left" id="project1"><a href="/elliotjoan7.github.io/Github_Poetry/>No Homo</a></div>
  <div class="text_right">
    <p><h3>PROJECT #1</h3></br>Found poetry using the google search results of one phrase. The phrase in question was the last thing one texted, which in my case was "no homo."
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="img_right" id="project2"><img src="images/witchy room.gif"></div>
  <div class="text_left">
    <p><h3>PROJECT #2</h3></br>An animated zoom background. This is meant to depict a stylized version of my room.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="img_left" id="project3"><a href="https://twinery.org/2/#!/stories/656ecae1-6d8c-4f43-ad1f-76b33f127f3f/play">Socks in the Water</a></div>
  <div class="text_right">
    <p><h3>PROJECT #3</h3></br>This is a twine game I created called "Socks in the Water." It's meant to walk the player through an awkward workplace scenerio
    and simulate what gender dysphoria may feel like.</p>
